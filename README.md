# Red-Summer-Internship

This repository contains my C++ projects for the internship application at CD PROJEKT RED:

- **BattleSim.cpp**: A simple turn-based battle simulator (Hero vs. Monster) using loops and conditions.
- **calculatorcpp.cpp**: A basic calculator that performs operations (+, -, *, /) with error handling and a loop for repeated calculations.
- **HelloName.cpp**: A greeting program that takes a name and age, and outputs a message based on age.
